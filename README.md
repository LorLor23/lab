Web scraping

This Python script automates the extraction of product information (like titles, prices, and descriptions) from websites. It efficiently handles broken links and missing data, allowing you to scrape from various sources. For enhanced security, you can encrypt the output CSV file. This user-friendly tool requires minimal setup and provides a clear structure for customization. It relies on popular libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and pycryptodome for data fetching, parsing, and encryption. The script is released under the permissive MIT License, enabling you to freely use and adapt it to your specific needs.
